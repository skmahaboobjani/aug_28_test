        What you see within a React component is ‘technically’ not HTML.

        Taking it to be HTML is the most common misconception about the React library.

        Let’s take a step back. We need to first look into how the barebones of React works.

        In React, we do NOT write any html directly. We use ‘React DOM’ nodes to specify how the page should be
        structured.
