    <h1>Is react a framework or a library</h1>
    <p>t's a framework. Honestly caring about the difference between a library and framework is a bit pedantic, so I'd say you can call it either.

        Having said that, my definitions of the two words are that a library is a collection of functions, and a framework is a way of doing things.
        
        By this definition, React is a framework because it forces you to build UI in the React way as opposed to the Angular or Ember, etc. way.
        
        On the other hand lodash is a perfect example of a library because it's just a collection of functions, use them however you like.</p>
